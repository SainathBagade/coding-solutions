# Smallest Divisible Digit Product I

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

You are given two integers `n` and `t`. Return the  **smallest**  number greater than or equal to `n` such that the  **product of its digits**  is divisible by `t`.

 

 **Example 1:** 

 **Input:**  n = 10, t = 2

 **Output:**  10

 **Explanation:** 

The digit product of 10 is 0, which is divisible by 2, making it the smallest number greater than or equal to 10 that satisfies the condition.

 **Example 2:** 

 **Input:**  n = 15, t = 3

 **Output:**  16

 **Explanation:** 

The digit product of 16 is 6, which is divisible by 3, making it the smallest number greater than or equal to 15 that satisfies the condition.

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= n <= 100
- 1 <= t <= 10

            i/=10;
            prod*=digit;
        }
        return prod;
    }
    int smallestNumber(int n, int t) {
    for(int i=n;i<=100;i++){

        int product=solve(i);
        if(product % t ==0){
            return i;
        }
    }
    return -1;
    }
};
